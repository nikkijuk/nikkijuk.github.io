					“You won’t appreciate the true horror, pain
					and suffering of microservices until you’re
					running them in production"

				#### Typical usecases

				<img alt="wf engine role" src="images/workflow_engine_usecases.jpg" width="50%">

				1. Asynchronous communication by commands and events — normally using a message or event bus

				2. Point-to-point communication by request/response — often REST

				3. Work distribution by workflow engine

				### what about accidental complexity?

				"although this isolation can add some overhead,
				the resulting simplicity makes our distributed system much easier to reason about."

					#### Embedded Process Engine (Microservice)

					"The process engine is added as an application library to a custom application.
					This way, the process engine can easily be turned on or off with the application lifecycle.
					It is possible to run multiple embedded process engines on top of the same shared database."

					Same jvm with app instance, shared database

					#### is it part of evolutionary architecture?

					“Once launched into production, our software will continue to evolve as the way it is used changes.
					For most things we create, we have to accept that once the software gets into the hands
					of our customers we will have to react and adapt, rather than it being a never-changing artifact.
					Thus, our architects need to shift their thinking away from creating the perfect end product,
					and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge,
					and continue to grow as we learn more.”
					― Sam Newman

				#### DigitalOps

				"enables rapid transformation by integrating humans and systems through the
				direct execution of process, decision and event models to automate business operations.
				It focuses on the dynamic combination and extension of component models, exploiting
				both choreography and orchestration aspects of process automation"
				- Gartner Hype Cycle for EA, 2021

				#### Before Camunda

				".. business processes of several organizations were manual or only partially automated
				using legacy digital process automation (DPA) suites, making them slow, inefficient,
				inconsistent, and disorganized. As a result, the enterprises found they were burdened with
				subpar customer service, and their employees were left frustrated by the time it took
				to accomplish common tasks."
				- Forrester, 2021
