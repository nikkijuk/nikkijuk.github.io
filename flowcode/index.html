				#### Program = Computation + Coordination

				"We can build a complete programming model out of two separate pieces -
				the computation model and the coordination model

				The computation model allows programmers to build a single
				computational activity: a single-threaded, step-at-a-time computation.

				The coordination model is the glue that binds separate activities into an ensemble."
				-	David Gelernter, Nicholas Carriero

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				### Ensembles

				"We will define an asynchronous ensemble (ensemble, for short) as a collection of
				asynchronous activities that communicate.
				An activity is a program, process, thread or any agent capable in principle
				of simulating a Turing Machine. It could be a person;
				it could be (recursively) another whole ensemble."
				-	David Gelernter, Nicholas Carriero

						</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				### Computations

				"a computation language by itself is useless. A computation must communicate with its environment or
				it serves no purpose. And the environment, insofar as it must ultimately be a person or people, can
				only be an active agent. A computation must perform operations whose purpose is to get information from
				or convey it to the environment, and these operations are a coordination language"

				#### workflows

				"Use process choreography and orchestration, where fitting, to manage long-running system-wide workflows.
				For simpler long-running business software processes that require limited individual steps,
				choreography is suitable.
				For more complex processes with a fair number of processing steps, orchestration works best."
				-  Vaughn Vernon, Tomasz Jaskula

					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				#### Choreography

				"Choreography is a process in which the decision to fulfill a given workflow step is
				left up to the individual subsystems.
				Each contextual subsystem must understand the stimulus, such as an event notification,
				that signals that a given step must happen next.
				Choreography is best reserved for simpler process workflows with few required steps."

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				#### Choreography, cons

				"when the process stalls somewhere, it can be difficult to determine where it went wrong and why.

				event dependencies become coupled to subsystems that don’t own the events, and must be subjectively interpreted and applied to their own purpose.

				dependencies on events can become quite tangled as system and process complexities increase."  - Vernon & Jaskula

					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				#### Orchestration

				"Orchestration is a process in which a central control mechanism guides the workflows steps
				by commanding each one to take place when and as directed.
				Orchestration is most useful when a process includes several or many complex steps,
				such as the policy underwriting workflow."
				-  Vaughn Vernon, Tomasz Jaskula

				#### Orchestration, cons

				"is designed and implemented by the team most interested in its ultimate outcome.
				They might become a blocker when changes are made across subsystems
				involved in the process that must be applied inside the orchestrator.

				might be too complex for controlling processes with less complexity.

				must not become a dungeon for business logic; it must be used only to drive steps of the process." - Vernon & Jaskula

				"Microservices require multiple resources to update, and distributed transactions are frowned on (for good reason).

				#### Without distribution (ACID, single db)

				- strong consistency
				- isolation of operations
				- atomic commits & rollbacks
				- changes are durable
				- referential integrity
				- joins between entities
				- where clauses & subqueries
				- single source of truth
				- locking, backups, ...

						</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				#### With distribution (n services & data sources)

				- consistent at the end of "distributed transaction"
				- changes visible when "local transaction" commits
				- need to use compensation instead of rollback
				- errors might prevent part of state changes and result inconsistent state
				- integrity checks need to be programmed
				- no joins, wheres & subqueries without copies of data or queries to other services
				- copies of data synced programmatically
				- no locks, set of backups, ...

				#### consistency, snapshots and availability

				- backups and restorations are always point in time
				- distributed systems push "time of consistency" until the "last" transaction gets completed
				- "eventually consistent backups" are permanently inconsistent, obsolete or have risk of data loss

				Failure of one database would need to push other databases back in time in order to recover to a consistent state.

				Or we just need to deal with inconsistency - orphaned data, broken links, ...

				Once upon a time King of Monolithian ruled his land with good system.
				Kings orders were consistent, system checked that their integrity was fine,
				they were made in isolation and committed to everyone simultaneously.
				If execution of orders was not possible they were rolled before harm was done.
				Everyone knew orders of King, and there always only one copy of them.
				This went well for a long time.

				It happened one day that Princess of Monolithian integrated with Prince of Distributian.
				Integration was done using pigeons, riding messengers and smoke signals.
				Pigeons were hunted, messengers drink too much and were late, smoke signals didn't work on rainy days.
				Laws were no more consistent, it was hard to know which messages were valid,
				if messages were complete and came to right order.
				Correcting falsely interpreted laws was hard, and often done only in one Kingdom.
				King didn't anymore know which laws were followed in Monolithian and Distributian...

				King understood that Monolithian and Distributian were autonomous Kingdoms
				and needed to work closely together.
				Keeping laws consistent was effortful but mandatory, since both kingdoms could change them.
				Often when problem occured in one kingdom, fixes and compensative actions were executed in both.
				King remembered how easy everything was before,
				but when younger rebellious Princess of Monolithian started on-off relatioship with
				Prince of Microservian King was happy that he already knew what to expect ...
