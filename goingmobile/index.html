				### Going mobile

				- limited: memory, disk, battery, screen size, ..
				- fragmented: new and old, premium and basic devices, many os versions, vendors, ..
				- connected: speed and data availability vary
				- secured: use of device capabilities if user allows access
				- sandboxed: process can be killed by os at any point if os needs resources

				"Instead of extending an existing class, give your new class a private field that references an instance of the existing class. This design is called composition because the existing class becomes a component of the new one. Each instance method in the new class invokes the corresponding method on the contained instance of the existing class and returns the results. This is known as forwarding, and the methods in the new class are known as forwarding methods."
