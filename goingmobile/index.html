				- fragmented: new and old, premium and basic devices, many os versions, vendors, ..
				- connected: speed and data availability vary
				- secured: use of device capabilities only if user allows access, rights can be revoked at any point

				- Fast pace of change

				## Flutter Recap
				- Flutter UI is reactive and declarative
				- Almost everything is a widget
				- Dart enables hot reload, JIT and AOT
				- Dart is easy to learn and has sound null safety
				- Usage of native / foreign code is supported
				- Architecture != State Management, you need both
				- Bloc is popular state management option
				- React/ReactNative have similarities to Flutter
				- Starting with MVP is good decision
