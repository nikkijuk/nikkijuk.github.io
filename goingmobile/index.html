				### Going mobile

				“This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” — A memo at Western Union, 1876 (or 1878)

				## Mobile programming
				- limited: memory, disk, battery, screen size, ..
				- fragmented: new and old, premium and basic devices, many os versions, vendors, ..
				- connected: speed and data availability vary
				- secured: use of device capabilities if user allows access
				- sandboxed: process can be killed by os at any point if os needs resources

				## implementation styles
				|  Style | Characteristics    |
				| ------ | -------------------|
				|  Web/Hybrid | We Love Web. And accept given tradeoffs. PWA, embedded WebView, Javascript bridge, .. |
				|  Native | We need control. And have team per platform. Android, Ios, Web, Desktop, Embedded, .. |
				|  Multiplatform | We value reuse. And MVP showed it works for us. Tradeoffs are clear, native skills still needed. |

				## Which style fits to me
				|  Style | When to use  |
				| ------ | ------------ |
				|  Web/Hybrid | Web app already exists, mobile app will be simple, I know how it works |
				|  Native | Only one platform will be ever needed, multiplatform doesn't fit to me, very tight platform integration  |
				|  Multiplatform | Multiplatform fits to me, my app isn't dead simple, I don't want to have team per platform |

				[NEW! HOT! .NET MAUI 6 Published 23rd may 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-dotnet-maui-one-codebase-many-platforms/)

				## Flutter: missing pieces?

				Flutter, like [React](https://reactjs.org/), is library for building user interfaces - it's very focused single purpose solution without compromises
				- some [1st party plugins](https://github.com/flutter/plugins) from flutter team are included - use them or not
				- plenty of [3rd party plugins](https://pub.dev/) are also present - best are [flutter favorites](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/favorites)
				- and nothing prevents you from implementing your [own plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages)

				#### [C interop using dart:ffi](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop)

				- use the [dart:ffi](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.18.2/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html) library to call native C APIs, and to read, write, allocate, and deallocate native memory.
				- use the [package:ffigen](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen) binding generator to automatically create FFI wrappers from C header files.
				- how you bundle and load a C library depends on your platform and the type of library.

				## DX: Nulls

				Mentioned native and multiplatform languages are statically typed with native null safety support
				- C# (Xamarin, .net MAUI)
				- Dart (Flutter)
				- Kotlin (Android Native)
				- Swift (iOS Native)

				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type

				Duck typing is kinda not static and not very safe. JS & ES & TS can be used in evil ways. With power comes responsibility.
