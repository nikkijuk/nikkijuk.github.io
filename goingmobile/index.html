				### Going mobile

				“This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” — A memo at Western Union, 1876 (or 1878)

				## Mobile is complex
				- limited: memory, disk, battery, screen size, ..
				- fragmented: new and old, premium and basic devices, many os versions, vendors, ..
				- connected: speed and data availability vary
				- secured: use of device capabilities only if user allows access
				- sandboxed: process can be killed by os at any point if os needs resources

				#### App development styles
				|  Style | When to consider  |
				| ------ | ------------ |
				|  Web/Hybrid | Web app already exists, mobile app will be simple, we know how JS works (been there, done that). |
				|  Native | Only one platform required, tight platform integration needed, app is technically complex  |
				|  *platform | We need to support several platforms, our app isn't dead simple, we don't want to have team per platform |

				#### We believe it works, but ..
				|  Style | Reconsider & test & decide   |
				| ------ | -----------------------------|
				|  Web/Hybrid | Select PWA or other stack. Do Web/Hybrid MVPs as long as needed. |
				|  Native | Our target plaforms have differences. Native seems only possibility. Ok, but still .. Do Multiplatform MVP. |
				|  *platform | We value reuse. MVP showed it works for us. Tradeoffs are clear, native skills still needed in team. Fine to go. |

				- plenty of [3rd party plugins](https://pub.dev/) are also present - best are [flutter favorites](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/favorites)

				- use the [dart:ffi](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.18.2/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html) library to call native C APIs, and to read, write, allocate, and deallocate native memory.
				- use the [package:ffigen](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen) binding generator to automatically create FFI wrappers from C header files.
				- how you bundle and load a C library depends on your platform and the type of library.

				## DX: Nulls

				Mentioned native and multiplatform languages are statically typed with native null safety support
				- C# (Xamarin, .net MAUI, Unity)
				- Dart (Flutter)
				- Kotlin (Android Native)
				- Swift (iOS Native)

				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type

				Duck typing is kinda not static and not very safe. JS & ES & TS can be used in evil ways. With power comes responsibility.

				## Flutter Recap
				- Can be embedded or used independently
				- Almost everything is a widget
				- UI is reactive and declarative
				- Usage of native / foreign code is possible
				- Dart enables hot reload, JIT and AOT
				- React/ReactNative have similarities to Flutter
				- Starting with MPV is good choice
