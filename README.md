# Experiments worth sharing

Very opinionated slidesets and presentation. 

## Contract: open api specification or full hateoas? modelling or coding?

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/stablecontracts/)

api driven: while model driven development (DSLs) and generating code reduces errors

code first: while it looks easy and there's fancy examples at stack overflow

## Software evolution: when learnings come code

[slides](http://localhost:63342/nikkijuk.github.io/infinitecode/)

If team is managing to embed to software everything they learn by observing how
users are using system it evonves.

If gap between what is known of users needs 
and what software provides grows 
it's only a matter of time when users 
dissatisfaction forces them to abandon software they hoped to provide value to them.

## distributed program flow

[slides](http://localhost:63342/nikkijuk.github.io/flowcode/)

what is microservices architecture?
what kind of coordination is required when local data and local computation needs to work in context of distributed systems.

## Becoming Software Developer

since it's not important how you learn to learn, but that you understand that it's process.

## Software Development Laws

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/softwarelaws/)

or [Kevlin Henney's "Old is The New New"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E)
