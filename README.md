# Experiments worth sharing

Very opinionated slidesets and presentation. 

Slides were made for presenting ideas in context of current project and company, which is not generic enough to make them something you should think in terms of "right" or "wrong". Some ideas might apply to other contexts also, but you should manage to estimate tradeoffs by yourself to decide if they have value to you. 

Not all of slidesets are finished. They might still be worth browsing, for which reason they are shared.

Why bother to think, iterate your ideas, a  sk why? Isn't it enough to just write next line of code? Read [Uwe Friedrichsen, Essential Architectural Thinking](https://speakerdeck.com/ufried/essential-architectural-thinking)

## About me

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/about/)

I have programmed for a long time. It's still fun and I enjoy it.

Currently I'm in mid way to understand that the whole power of what I have done is not a skill of decoding commands to computer. 
It's all on persons, interaction, within team, with customers. I'm curious to understand more of it.

To understand where I am and why I am I tend to think organisations and environments where I have worked.
All of those environments have influenced me, but currently I'm more aware about what they do to me.
I am one of the global few persons who doesn't need to work for money, but I still see how 
[the Way We Think about Work is Broken - Barry Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKl-C-VMqYA)

"(..) what Adam Smith was telling us there is
that the very shape of the institution,
within which people work, creates people
who are fitted to the demands of that
institution, and deprives people of the
opportunity to derive the kinds of
satisfactions from their work that we
take for granted" - Barry Schwartz

I'm motivated by search of understanding boundaries and possibilities, 
what I can professionally offer to others and what I need.
Curiousity has lead me to wonder
[how to activate the ‘seeking system’ of your brain - Dan Cable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4yVofxXpT0)

"what's interesting is if you start with humanity, and you start with 
"you're a person, 
there are probably things about you that are unique,
that we should know about".
Why don't we start by socializing
some of the ways that were unique, and that we add value to the team. 
And I think by humanizing that relationship, it's so simple, 
but it actually stands out as being rare." - Dan Cable

Mindsets are important. 
Developing Growth mindset can be learned.

"Making mistakes and coming up with solutions
to solve your problems is exercise for your brain. 
Whoa! It's brainercize!
Right! When you believe you can do it and you keep trying,
that's when your brain is growing and you're learning
new things." - Sesame Street

## Scrum basics

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/scrumbasics/)

"agile, adjective - able to move quickly and easily" - Oxford Dictionary

Agile isn't "done" by following Scrum. Scrum is just a tool to help you to communicate.
If you don't understand why you are doing Scrum, maybe you should not do it.
Or: you can try to understand it better.

This is my take on Scrum basics. 
It's written for non-professional purpose, and is partially in German, but it might be useful for you also.

But if you want to learn, then, where to start? See [A S C R U M B O O K](https://scrumbook.org/), it's free to browse online.

All golden? No, see ["Agile Methods The Good, the Hype and the Ugly," Bertrand Meyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffkIQrq-m34) or read his book.

But you might also want to see [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/) as it's "the" official source of Scrum. 

Whatever you do; remember, many projects fail. Regardless of methodology. 
Is Agile better? Is Scrum better? Maybe, but it's not a a secure way to success.

## Brainhacks: How to enhance human potential usage for software development?

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/brainhacks/)

Themes

- Your team is not performing? Maybe it's not team at all.
- Where did happy go? and where comes motivation.
- Trust is the key. But how to build it?
- It's not just bricks. We build cathedrals.
- Happiness is on your relationships to others.

That's not technical stuff, but how to enable people to work together better.
Sure it's also about money and profitabilty, as
[Teresa Amabile - The Progress Principle - ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD6N8bsjOEE&t=935s) states that
"dissatisfaction leads to slower revenue growth and lower profitability, 
in other words,  employee engagement drives the bottom line".

Important to you is also [Does your job match your personality?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEvqMN75sCI),
which [Jordan Peterson](https://bigthink.com/videos/how-important-is-it-that-your-job-matches-your-personality-extremely/)
comments
“If you’re a creative person who is open to trying new things 
— openness being one of the Big Five personality traits 
— you’re more likely to succeed at jobs that require novel solutions over efficient ones. 
On the other hand, if you’re conscientious 
— another Big Five personality trait 
— you’re likely to be better off in a management or administrative position.”

There's good reason to solve conflict between
software developers and managers,
or said otherwise: between creative - open - and administrative - conscientious - persons / roles..

As [Jordan Peterson](https://bigthink.com/videos/how-important-is-it-that-your-job-matches-your-personality-extremely/)
observes
“So there’s this terrible tension in organizations, 
and I think what generally happens is all the creative people are there at the beginning. 
They get chased out until you have nothing but managers and administrators. 
Then the environment shifts, then the company dies. 
And so the way that capitalism solves the problem of the tension between the creative types 
and the managerial types is it just lets companies die.

Now you might think, “Well I don’t want my company to die.” 
It’s like okay then, you need to understand the difference between these two kinds of people
— which you probably won’t and you probably won’t admit to even if you knew. 
And then you have to figure out how to get the balance right. 
And so that’s extraordinarily complicated.”

This is mostly sales for Flutter. It's partly outdated, partly still valid.

Flutter is cool, so maybe I'll update this someday. 

## Contract: open api specification or full hateoas? modelling or coding?

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/stablecontracts/)

api driven: while model driven development (DSLs) and generating code reduces errors.

code first: while it looks easy and there's fancy examples at stack overflow.

Decision lies on your culture, usecase and legacy codebase. I have very strong opinion that modelling and sharing contracts openly would be valuable, but also that it's rare capability, which many companies might not have.

## Software evolution: when learnings come code

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/infinitecode/)

If team is managing to embed to software everything they learn by observing how users are using system, it evolves. If team is not learning or not capable of changing their system according their growing knowledge, it suffers, and is in danger.

If gap between what is known of users needs and what software provides grows 
it's only a matter of time when users 
dissatisfaction forces them to abandon software they hoped to provide value.
