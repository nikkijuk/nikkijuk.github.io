# Experiments worth sharing

Very opinionated slidesets and presentation. 

Slides were made for presenting ideas in context of current project and company, which is not generic enough to make them something you should think in terms of "right" or "wrong". Some ideas might apply to other contexts also, but you should manage to estimate tradeoffs by yourself to decide if they have value to you. 

Not all of slidesets are finished. They might still be worth browsing, for which reason they are shared.

Why bother to think, iterate your ideas, ask why? Isn't it enough to just write next line of code? Read [Uwe Friedrichsen, Essential Architectural Thinking](https://speakerdeck.com/ufried/essential-architectural-thinking)

## Contract: open api specification or full hateoas? modelling or coding?

[slides](https://nikkijuk.github.io/stablecontracts/)

api driven: while model driven development (DSLs) and generating code reduces errors.

code first: while it looks easy and there's fancy examples at stack overflow.

Decision lies on your culture, usecase and legacy codebase. I have very strong opinion that modelling and sharing contracts openly would be valuable, but also that it's capability which many companies might not have.

## Software evolution: when learnings come code

[slides](http://localhost:63342/nikkijuk.github.io/infinitecode/)

If team is managing to embed to software everything they learn by observing how users are using system it evolves.

If gap between what is known of users needs 
and what software provides grows 
it's only a matter of time when users 
dissatisfaction forces them to abandon software they hoped to provide value to them.

## distributed program flow

[slides](http://localhost:63342/nikkijuk.github.io/flowcode/)

what is microservices architecture?
what kind of coordination is required when local data and local computation needs to work in context of distributed systems.

## Becoming Software Developer

or [Kevlin Henney's "It Depends."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNSVZs66o48)

since it's not important how you learn to learn, but that you understand that it's process.
