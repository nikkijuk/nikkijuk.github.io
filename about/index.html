				### @nikkijuk

				"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
				He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
				Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures."
				—Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month


				“Everyday life is like programming, I guess.
				If you love something you can put beauty on it.”

				"I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification,
				design, and testing of this conceptual construct,
				not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation." - Fred Brooks

				- Model: Domain, Requirements, Architecture
				- Representation: Code, Tests, Documentation

				If you can't explain it, you can't build it. Models are views to reality.
				Reality needs to be shared and understood by all stakeholders.

				### Shameless [closing quote](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/this-1-simple-way-of-thinking-separates-smartest-people-from-everyone-else.html)

				"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein


				“People think that computer science is the art of geniuses
				but the actual reality is the opposite,
				just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.”
				― Donald Knuth

				It's only possible to succeed together, to trust and build on shared commitment.
				Curiosity, playing with ideas and learning from others
				are most important traits and skills in knowledge game called "work".
