				trying to be the smartest person to making everyone else smarter." - Gregor Hohpe

				Every system is product of people who built it.
				It has tremendous influence to results how those people

				#### Skills: Iterate from Abstract to Concrete

				"I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification,
				design, and testing of this conceptual construct,
				not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation." - Fred Brooks

				- Model: Domain, Requirements, Architecture
				- Representation: Code, Tests, Documentation

				If you can't explain it, you can't build it. Models are views to reality.
				Reality needs to be shared and understood by all stakeholders.

				### Shameless [closing quote](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/this-1-simple-way-of-thinking-separates-smartest-people-from-everyone-else.html)

				"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein

				Being generalist is hard. You know you don't know all, but you'd like to know more.
				It's only possible to succeed together, to trust and build on shared commitment.
				This is professional reality I want to experience with likeminded people.
				It's still like doing demos with Nikki Corruptions, but stakes are bigger.

				"Bad software architecture is a people problem.
				When people don't work well together they make bad decisions." - Kate Matsudaira

				"The architect's role is changing from being primarily a decision maker
				to being a coordinator, advisor, and knowledge manager
				... a central knowledge hub." - Rainer Weinreich & Iris Groher

				"Excessive complexity is natureâ€™s punishment
				for organizations that are unable to make decisions." - Gregor Hohpe
