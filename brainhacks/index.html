				"Think what one thing can you do tomorrow to enable someone to make progress on meaningful work. Do it and then celebrate that progress. Make that a daily discipline." - Teresa Amabile

				#### [Progress Principle & DevEx](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878)

				Because inner work life has such a potent effect on creativity and productivity,
				and because small but consistent steps forward, shared by many people,
				can accumulate into excellent execution, progress events that often go unnoticed

				#### George Gallup, 1958

				While the standard retirement age
				for men in the 1950s was closer to 65, men who
				lived to see 95 did not retire until they were 80 years old on
				average. Even more remarkable, 93% of these men reported
				getting a great deal of satisfaction out of the work they did, and
				86% reported having fun doing their job.
