				“Agile is not a methodology, it’s a mindset.
				It’s a way of thinking that values individuals and interactions over processes and tools.”
				– Larman, Craig

				“Agile is not about doing more work faster.
				It’s about creating an environment where teams can work together more effectively.”
				– Kniberg, Henrik

				Agile methodologies are built on the pillars of self-organization,
				self-reflection, and self-adjustment.

				They are based on creating an environment in which people can agree and commit
				to the organizational goals, and they are given trust to make their own decisions
				about how they organize the work.

				These frameworks cannot fit in an organizational environment in which Theory X beliefs are predominant.

				even the best leader on the planet can’t make a team do well.
				All anyone can do is increase the likelihood that a team will be great
				by putting into place five conditions.

				1. teams must be real.
				2. teams need a compelling direction.
				3. teams need enabling structures.
				4. teams need a supportive organization.

				There are many cases where collaboration, particularly in truly creative endeavors,
				is a hindrance rather than a help.

				The challenge for a leader is to find a balance between individual autonomy
				and collective action.

				Either extreme is bad, though we
				are generally more aware of the downside of individualism

				"All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists. But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: “This time it will surely run” or “I just found the last bug.”"
