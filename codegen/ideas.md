prompt + llm => monolithic code 

prompt + llm + context + constraints + spec + ai agent + architecture => modular code

prompt = request / instructions
llm = language knowledge / capabilities
context = legacy code / documentation
constraints = rules / limitations
spec = specification / requirements
ai agent = mcp server / tools
architecture = subsystems / packages

deterministic

mdd = model (uml, sysml, ..) + generator  => code
dsl = model (text) + generator => code 

dsl variants: external (text) or internal (code)

non deterministic

sdd = spec + llm + .. => code
