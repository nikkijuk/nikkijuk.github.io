### Codegen 2.0

“Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express
the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements.
We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements
into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision —
so there will always be code.”
― Robert C. Martin

["Spec-driven development means writing a “spec” before writing code with AI.
The spec becomes the source of truth for the human and the AI."](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html)

Spec has aspects like architecture, domain models, requirements
and can be refined over time.

### [Possible Use-cases?](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

<img alt="nc 1990" src="images/sdd-usecases.png" width="80%">

- New solution from spec (e.g. feature, module)
- Renew solutions (code => spec, spec => new code)
- Spec as DSL for business logic

### [Levels](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html)

- Spec-first: A well thought-out spec is written first, and then used in the AI-assisted development workflow for the task at hand.
- Spec-anchored: The spec is kept even after the task is complete, to continue using it for evolution and maintenance of the respective feature.
- Spec-as-source: The spec is the main source file over time, and only the spec is edited by the human, the human never touches the code.

				### [SDD is non-deterministic](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/insights/blog/agile-engineering-practices/spec-driven-development-unpacking-2025-new-engineering-practices)

"Spec drift and hallucination are inherently difficult to avoid.
We still need highly deterministic CI/CD practices to ensure software quality
and safeguard our architectures." - Liu Shangqi

None of the current best practices like unit tests, CI/CD pipelines,
Linting, autoformatting, modular architecture, code reviews, etc.
are outdated by SDD. They are more important than ever.

there’s a lack of consensus on the ‘correct’ spec-driven development workflow and what exactly a good spec should look like in the context of AI-assisted coding.

#### [when the spec becomes the primary artifact](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

- Every developer needs to think like an architect.
- Organizations must adapt operationally.
- Architectural clarity must be prioritized.
- Teams need training to build specification literacy.

Writing or refining specifications requires the same level of systems thinking
that was once limited to senior technical roles.

				#### [Bold predictions](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

Businesses that rely solely on AI-generated code without structured specs
accumulate hallucinated logic, inconsistent patterns, and unpredictable failures.
But those that adopt SDD will shift from code ownership –
where engineers fight to keep implementations aligned to intent ownership –
where specifications drive the entire lifecycle.

					# Summary

- Spec-driven development (SDD) is an emerging paradigm
that leverages AI to generate code from structured specifications.
- SDD can improve code quality, maintainability, and alignment with business goals.
- Successful adoption of SDD requires new workflows, tools, and mindsets.
- SDD does not work on all projects equally well. In some it should not be used.
