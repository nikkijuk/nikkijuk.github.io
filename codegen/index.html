#### Codegen 2.0 / Spec-Driven Development
“Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express
the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements.
We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements
into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision —
so there will always be code.”
― Robert C. Martin

#### Codegen 1.0

- code from model (MDD, Model driven development, e.g. Enterprise Architect, IBM Rhapsody)
- code from architecture (MDA, Model driven architecture, e.g. ArchiMate)
- code from domain-specific language, often custom syntax (external DSL, e.g. Xtext, JetBrains MPS)

Deterministic, mature, but limited adoption.
Tools either proprietary or not feasible for general use (learning curve, license costs).

#### Codegen 2.0 / AI-assisted development

- Assistants (eg. Github CoPilot, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, Jetbrains AI)
- IDE's (Eg. Google Antigravity, Kilo AI, Roo-Code)
- Prototype generators (eg. Figma Make, Miro AI, v0)
- Code from spec (eg. GitHub SpecKit, AWS Kiro, Tessl)

Tools are emerging rapidly, but still experimental. No standard practices.
Same challenges as in traditional coding (quality, security, maintainability, ..)

#### Codegen 1.0 & 2.0 synergy

- Codegen 1.0 can generate boilerplate code as well as Codegen 2.0 inputs.
- Codegen 2.0 can transform Codegen 1.0 outputs and orchestrate codegen 1.0 tools usage.

It's possible to combine both approaches for better results.
Custom MCP servers can be created to wrap Codegen 1.0 tools,
for example with Jetbrains Koog.ai.

#### [Spec-Driven Development (SDD)](https://www.infoq.com/articles/spec-driven-development/)

<img alt="nc 1990" src="images/spec-driven-development.png" width="60%">

["Spec-driven development means writing a “spec” before writing code with AI.
The spec becomes the source of truth for the human and the AI."](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html)

Spec has aspects like architecture, domain models, requirements
and can be refined over time.

#### [Specification over code](https://www.infoq.com/articles/spec-driven-development/)

SDD represents a fundamental shift in how software systems are architected, governed, and evolved.

At a technical level, it introduces a declarative, contract-centric control plane that repositions
the specification as the system's primary executable artifact.

Implementation code, in contrast, becomes a secondary, generated representation of architectural intent.

<img alt="nc 1990" src="images/sdd_vs_classical_model.png" width="80%">

For decades, software architecture has operated under a largely unchallenged assumption that code is the ultimate authority.

### [SDD Use-cases](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

<img alt="nc 1990" src="images/sdd-usecases.png" width="80%">

- New solution from spec (e.g. feature, module, ..)
- Renew solutions (code => spec, spec => new code)
- Spec as DSL for business logic (part of system)

<img alt="nc 1990" src="images/sdd-time-division.jpeg" width="60%">

- Theory: phase lengths change. Reality: phases overlap, spec is continuously refined / validated.
- Work content changes and adapts. Required skill combination might be rather uncommon.
- New roles emerge (spec architect, spec engineer, ..). There might be scaling bottlenecks.

### [SDD Levels](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html)

- Spec-first: A well thought-out spec is written first, and then used in the AI-assisted development workflow for the task at hand.
- Spec-anchored: The spec is kept even after the task is complete, to continue using it for evolution and maintenance of the respective feature.
- Spec-as-source: The spec is the main source file over time, and only the spec is edited by the human, the human never touches the code.

				### [SDD is non-deterministic](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/insights/blog/agile-engineering-practices/spec-driven-development-unpacking-2025-new-engineering-practices)

"Spec drift and hallucination are inherently difficult to avoid.
We still need highly deterministic CI/CD practices to ensure software quality
and safeguard our architectures." - Liu Shangqi

None of the current best practices like unit tests, CI/CD pipelines,
Linting, autoformatting, modular architecture, code reviews, etc.
are outdated by SDD. They are more important than ever.

#### [when the spec becomes the primary artifact](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

- Every developer needs to think like an architect.
- Organizations must adapt operationally.
- Architectural clarity must be prioritized.
- Teams need training to build specification literacy.

Writing or refining specifications requires the same level of systems thinking
that was once limited to senior technical roles.

				#### [SDD Hypothesis](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/spec-driven-development-explained/)

Businesses that rely solely on AI-generated code without structured specs
accumulate hallucinated logic, inconsistent patterns, and unpredictable failures.

But those that adopt SDD will shift from code ownership –
where engineers fight to keep implementations aligned to intent ownership –
where specifications drive the entire lifecycle.

					### Challenges

- SDD requires cultural change and shifts power dynamics in teams and organizations.
- Collaboration with non-technical stakeholders is essential, coder alone cannot deliver.
- Caps in specs coverage and quality are detected early, not at the end of development.
- Tooling and processes are immature and evolving rapidly, requiring continuous learning.
- Existing codebases may not be suitable for SDD adoption, and first projects may be risky.

					### Summary

- Spec-driven development (SDD) uses AI to generate code from structured specifications.
- Role of developer shifts from code to describe intent and architecture in specs.
- SDD can improve code quality, maintainability, and alignment with business goals.
- Successful adoption of SDD requires new workflows, tools, and mindsets.
- SDD does not work on all projects equally well. Careful experimentation is needed.
