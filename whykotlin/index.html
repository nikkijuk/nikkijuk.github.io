						"what would be a significant improvement would be to make all variables not-null by default.

					"Kotlin has no primitives, at least not at the programmer level. Instead, it uses Java primitives under the hood to make computation faster. But you, as the programmer, will only be manipulating objects. The object class for integers is different than the object representation of integers in Java. Instead of Integer, you’ll use the Int class."

				"Int is said to be a non-nullable type, whereas Int? is a nullable type. Kotlin uses this mechanism for all types, which exist in two versions: nullable (postfixed with a ?) and non-nullable. The most interesting part of the story is that any non-nullable type is a child type of the corresponding nullable type"

						"Kotlin guesses the type by looking forward to the value used to initialize the field. (..) It’s generally wise, however, to specify the type. By doing so, you can check that the type inferred by Kotlin is the type you expect. Believe me, that won’t always be the case!"

				#### Programming paradigms

				imperative
				- procedural, groups instructions into procedures
				- object-oriented, groups instructions with state they operate on

				declarative
				- functional, result is value of a series of functions
				- reactive, result is propagation of change of data streams

				"One of Kotlin’s most popular features is its support for coroutines, which allow developers to write concurrent code as though it was synchronous. That support makes it much easier to write concurrent code that employs coroutines than using other techniques, like callback methods or reactive streams."

				"Coroutines are lightweight threads; you can create hundreds of thousands of them, whereas you cannot create that many threads. They provide you with building blocks that allow better scalability and allow new constructs, especially if you deal with asynchronous calls and applications with a lot of I/O, which is typically the case on the server side."

				"Coroutines are now the default way to go Reactive in Kotlin. (..) When you select Kotlin and one of the Reactive dependencies on start.spring.io, the Coroutines dependency will be automatically added."

						      launch {
						        delay(1000L - i * 10)
						        print("❤️$i ")
							}}}

					"The convention of running all coroutines inside coroutineScope to ensure that if one fails, all will be cancelled, is known as structured concurrency."
