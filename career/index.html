				## Career changes

				"The success of everything depends on intuition,
				the capacity of seeing things in a way which afterwards proves to be true,
				even though it cannot be established at the moment,
				and of grasping the essential fact, discarding the unessential,
				even though one can give no account of the principles by which this is done." - Joseph A. Schumpeter

				- Representation: Code, Tests, Documentation

				If you can't explain it, you can't build it. Models are views to reality.
				Reality needs to be shared and understood by all stakeholders.

				### Shameless [closing quote](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/this-1-simple-way-of-thinking-separates-smartest-people-from-everyone-else.html)

				"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein


				“People think that computer science is the art of geniuses
				but the actual reality is the opposite,
				just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.”
				― Donald Knuth

				It's only possible to succeed together, to trust and build on shared commitment.
				Curiosity, playing with ideas and learning from others
				are most important traits and skills in knowledge game called "work".
