				### Software development laws

				"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

				"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits." - Kent Beck

						// FIXME: Replace Bad Habits with Good Habits

					‘A  major  purpose  of  education  is  to  cultivate  open-mindedness  and  intelligence.  Defined  in  terms  of  the  aptitude  for  acquiring  knowledge, intelligence depends upon an alert curiosity. The cultivation of intelligence depends on freedom to exercise curiosity.’

					- Jiddu Krishnamurti

				- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
				- System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.

				## second law of thermodynamics

				"The second law of thermodynamics, in principle, states that a closed system's disorder cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is entropy. This law also seems plausible for software systems; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as software entropy."

				## Tesler’s Law of Conservation as Complexity

				“Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction.”

				or: user learns it .. maybe?

				"There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone." - Bjarne Stroustrup

				## Zawinski’s Law

				“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are replaced by ones that can.”

				or: Feature creep

				"extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication, rather than simple design."

				## Lehman's laws

				"As an evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting deteriorating structure, increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it."

				or: Technical Debt

				"internal things that you choose not to do now, but which will impede future development if left undone. This includes deferred refactoring."

				## Gall’s Law

				“A complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system built from scratch won’t work.”

				Or: KISS principle

				"simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided."

					## ETC Principle

					"A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing. So we believe in the ETC principle: Easier to Change. ETC. That’s it." -	Dave Thomas, Andrew Hunt, 2019

					or: SOLID this and that ..

					"By applying these 5 principles that make the SOLID acronym, we get to benefit from a reusable, maintainable, scalable and easy testable codebase." ;)

				## Pesticide Paradox

				“If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test cases will no longer find new bugs.”

				or: why static systems don't heal themselves ..

				"The system of nature, of which man is a part, tends to be self-balancing, self-adjusting, self-cleansing. Not so with technology."

				E.F. Schumacher

				## Watsons Dirty little secret

				"The nature of the beast is that software requirements rarely change; what changes is our awareness of them, and our grasp of their implications.

				The dirty little secret in the software industry is that at the outset of every project, we don’t really know what we’re doing."

						## Pareto principle, 20/80 rule

						"For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes"

						aka

						"80% of users only use 20% of application’s features"

						aka Muda on Lean / Feature creep

						"features not often used by customers are waste"

				## The 90-90 Rule

				“The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.”

				or: definition of almost done, #noEstimates

				"estimating is fundamentally guessing, yet these guesses are taken as promises"

					## Humphrey’s Law

					“For a new software system, the requirements will not be completely known until after the users have used it.”

					or: as Rumsfeld says

					"there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know."

					or is it just Planning Fallacy here?

					"Each release represents our next “best laid plan”, which survives right up until it makes contact with the customer."

				## Dunning–Kruger Effect

				"People who lack the most knowledge on a topic also lack the ability to recognize their own mistakes and errors, making them exceptionally confident and biased self-evaluators. They are also unable to fairly judge other people’s performance."

				but cognitive error happens on other end of spectrum also

				"Meanwhile, true experts often underrate themselves -- they’re so knowledgable on the subject, they can see how much they don’t know."

				## Putt’s Law

				“Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.”

				or: blame-game is not a solution

				"Blaming programmers has been the prevailing approach for a half century of software development: It has not solved the problem yet, so it is time to look in different directions." – Boris Beizer

				## Flon’s Law

				"There is not now, nor will there ever be, a programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to write bad code."

				but there's reason to try to write good code

				## Eagleson’s law

				“Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.”
