				## second law of thermodynamics

				"The second law of thermodynamics, in principle, states that a closed system's disorder cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is entropy. This law also seems plausible for software systems; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as software entropy."

				#### Tesler’s Law of Conservation as Complexity

				“Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction.”

				--

				"For every 10-percent increase in problem complexity, there is a 100-percent increase in the software solution’s complexity. That’s not a condition to try to change (even though reducing complexity is always desirable); that’s just the way it is." — Robert Glass

					## Hoare's Maxim

					"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."

					## Occam’s Razor

					“The simplest solution is most likely the right one.”

				## Zawinski’s Law

				“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are replaced by ones that can.”

				or: Feature creep

				"extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication, rather than simple design."

				## Lehman's laws

				"As an evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting deteriorating structure, increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it."

				or: Technical Debt

				"internal things that you choose not to do now, but which will impede future development if left undone. This includes deferred refactoring."

				## Gall’s Law

				“A complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system built from scratch won’t work.”

				Or: KISS principle

				"simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided."

					## ETC Principle

					"A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing. So we believe in the ETC principle: Easier to Change. ETC. That’s it." -	Dave Thomas, Andrew Hunt, 2019

					or: SOLID this and that ..

					"By applying these 5 principles that make the SOLID acronym, we get to benefit from a reusable, maintainable, scalable and easy testable codebase." ;)

				"you are always taught to do as much as you can. Always put checks in. Always look for exceptions. Always handle the most general case. Always give the user the best advice. Always print a meaningful error message. Always this. Always that. You have so many things in the background that you're supposed to do, there's no room left to think. I say, forget all that and ask yourself, "What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?"" - Ward Cunningham

				## Watsons Dirty little secret

				"The nature of the beast is that software requirements rarely change; what changes is our awareness of them, and our grasp of their implications.

				The dirty little secret in the software industry is that at the outset of every project, we don’t really know what we’re doing."

					## Humphrey’s Law

					“For a new software system, the requirements will not be completely known until after the users have used it.”

					or: as Rumsfeld says

					"there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know."

					or is it just Planning Fallacy here?

					"Each release represents our next “best laid plan”, which survives right up until it makes contact with the customer."

				<section data-markdown>

					## Planning fallacy

					"The planning fallacy is a term used by psychologists to describe our tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task.

					Key reasons:

					1. Failing to consider how long it's taken us to complete similar tasks in the past

					2. Assuming that we won't run into any complications that will cause delays"

				## The 90-90 Rule

				“The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.”

						"80% of users only use 20% of application’s features"

						aka Muda on Lean / Feature creep

				## Putt’s Law

				“Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.”

				or: blame-game is not a solution

				"Blaming programmers has been the prevailing approach for a half century of software development: It has not solved the problem yet, so it is time to look in different directions." – Boris Beizer

				## [10x Programmer Myth](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/programmer-moneyball-challenging-the-myth-of-individual-programmer-productivity/)

				"most of the differences resulted from a few very low performances, rather than exceptional high performance. Second, there are very few programmers at the extremes. Third, the same programmers were seldom best or worst.
				While average performance differs between programmers, only half the variation in program-development effort can be attributed to inherent programmer skill; the other half is within the individual developer's day-to-day variation. "	- Bill Nichols, 2020

				## Dunning–Kruger Effect

				"People who lack the most knowledge on a topic also lack the ability to recognize their own mistakes and errors, making them exceptionally confident and biased self-evaluators. They are also unable to fairly judge other people’s performance."

				but cognitive error happens on other end of spectrum also

				"Meanwhile, true experts often underrate themselves -- they’re so knowledgable on the subject, they can see how much they don’t know."
