The successful Java programming language gave us a hard shove in that direction, and the new paradigm stuck. Many developers got caught with old skills and had to completely retool the way they thought, the tools they used, and the way they designed applications."

				"Instead of extending an existing class, give your new class a private field that references an instance of the existing class. This design is called composition because the existing class becomes a component of the new one. Each instance method in the new class invokes the corresponding method on the contained instance of the existing class and returns the results. This is known as forwarding, and the methods in the new class are known as forwarding methods."
