				### Software development laws

				"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

				"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits." - Kent Beck

						// Name: Jukka Nikki, Identity: Programmer, Since: 6502
						// FIXME: Replace Bad Habits with Good Habits

				## Zawinski’s Law

				“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are replaced by ones that can.”

				or: Feature creep

				"extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication, rather than simple design."

					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				## Lehman's laws

				"As an evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting deteriorating structure, increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it."

				or: Technical Debt

				"internal things that you choose not to do now, but which will impede future development if left undone. This includes deferred refactoring."

					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				## Gall’s Law

				“A complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system built from scratch won’t work.”

				Or: KISS principle

				"simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided."
					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
					## ETC Principle

					"A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing. So we believe in the ETC principle: Easier to Change. ETC. That’s it." -	Dave Thomas, Andrew Hunt, 2019

					or: SOLID this and that ..

					"By applying these 5 principles that make the SOLID acronym, we get to benefit from a reusable, maintainable, scalable and easy testable codebase." ;)

					## Humphrey’s Law

					“For a new software system, the requirements will not be completely known until after the users have used it.”

					or: as Rumsfeld says

					"there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know."

						## Pareto principle, 20/80 rule

						"80% of results come from 20% of the causes."

						aka

						"80% of users only use 20% of application’s features"

						aka Muda on Lean / Feature creep

						"features not often used by customers are waste"

				## The 90-90 Rule

				“The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.”

				or: definition of almost done, #noEstimates

				"estimating is fundamentally guessing, yet these guesses are taken as promises"

				## Tesler’s Law of Conservation as Complexity

				“Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction.”

				or: user learns it .. maybe?

				"There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone." - Bjarne Stroustrup

				## One Skull Rule by Jesse Watson

				"The most valuable asset in the software industry is the synthesis of programming skill and deep context in the business problem domain, in one skull."

				or: 10x superpower which is hardly given value

				"Domain Knowledge: One of the most under-appreciated skills that programmers have; and a key reason why programmers aren't commodities." - wiki.c2.com

				## Lister’s Law

				“People under time pressure don’t think faster”

				direct result of Planning Fallacy and Optimism Bias

				"when planning future work we do not accurately recall the risks or the effort in completing similar work in the past."
					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
				## Brooks’ law

				“Adding manpower to a late project makes it later.”

				or

				"What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months."

				or

				"nine women can't make a baby in one month"

				## Dunning–Kruger Effect

				"People who lack the most knowledge on a topic also lack the ability to recognize their own mistakes and errors, making them exceptionally confident and biased self-evaluators. They are also unable to fairly judge other people’s performance."

				but cognitive error happens on other end of spectrum also

				"Meanwhile, true experts often underrate themselves -- they’re so knowledgable on the subject, they can see how much they don’t know."

				## Putt’s Law

				“Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.”

				or: blame-game goes to two directions

				"Blaming programmers has been the prevailing approach for a half century of software development: It has not solved the problem yet, so it is time to look in different directions." – Boris Beizer
