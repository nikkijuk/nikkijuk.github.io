				### Software development laws

				"The hard part isn't the technology — the number one failure of the software industry is building the wrong product."

				and

				"If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." - Edsger W. Dijkstra

					"A  major  purpose  of  education  is  to  cultivate  open-mindedness  and  intelligence.  Defined  in  terms  of  the  aptitude  for  acquiring  knowledge, intelligence depends upon an alert curiosity. The cultivation of intelligence depends on freedom to exercise curiosity."

				"All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists. But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: “This time it will surely run” or “I just found the last bug.”"

				## second law of thermodynamics

				"The second law of thermodynamics, in principle, states that a closed system's disorder cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is entropy. This law also seems plausible for software systems; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as software entropy."

				#### Tesler’s Law of Conservation as Complexity

				“Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction.”

				--

				"For every 10-percent increase in problem complexity, there is a 100-percent increase in the software solution’s complexity. That’s not a condition to try to change (even though reducing complexity is always desirable); that’s just the way it is." — Robert Glass

					## Hoare's Maxim

					"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."

					## ETC Principle

					## Planning fallacy

					"The planning fallacy is a term used by psychologists to describe our tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task.

					Key reasons:

					2. Assuming that we won't run into any complications that will cause delays"

				## Watsons Dirty little secret

				"The nature of the beast is that software requirements rarely change; what changes is our awareness of them, and our grasp of their implications.

				## Jukkas Great Advice

				- Programming is just one skill you need
				- Become so fluent on programming that you have capacity to learn "The hard stuff"
				- Being efficient all the time is not only impossible, but it's also damaging you
				- Understanding users needs is not "somebody elses" job, but everyones, including you
				- Domain knowledge does not only elevate your value, but it makes programming meaningless

				## Dunning–Kruger Effect

				"People who lack the most knowledge on a topic also lack the ability to recognize their own mistakes and errors, making them exceptionally confident and biased self-evaluators. They are also unable to fairly judge other people’s performance."

				## [10x Programmer Myth](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/programmer-moneyball-challenging-the-myth-of-individual-programmer-productivity/)

				"most of the differences resulted from a few very low performances, rather than exceptional high performance. Second, there are very few programmers at the extremes. Third, the same programmers were seldom best or worst.
				While average performance differs between programmers, only half the variation in program-development effort can be attributed to inherent programmer skill; the other half is within the individual developer's day-to-day variation. "	- Bill Nichols, 2020
