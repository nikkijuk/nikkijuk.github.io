					"A  major  purpose  of  education  is  to  cultivate  open-mindedness  and  intelligence.  Defined  in  terms  of  the  aptitude  for  acquiring  knowledge, intelligence depends upon an alert curiosity. The cultivation of intelligence depends on freedom to exercise curiosity."

					Key reasons:

					2. Assuming that we won't run into any complications that will cause delays"

				#### Gut feeling for design?

				and immediately get a "feel" for its quality, without getting bogged down in extensive
				"logically detailed arguments"". - c2

				## Jukkas Short Advice

				- Programming is just one skill you need
				- Become so fluent on programming that you have capacity to learn "The hard stuff"
				- Being efficient all the time is not only impossible, but it's also damaging you
				- Understanding users needs is not "somebody elses" job, but everyones, including you
				- Domain knowledge does not only elevate your value, but it makes programming meaningless

				#### Summary, your future to come

				"All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists. But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: “This time it will surely run” or “I just found the last bug.”"
